##Idea behind using Transfer learning
 - Instead of training a deep network from scratch, we can actually take a pre-trained network and use it for a different task as learning of a new task relies on the previously learned tasks.
 - Assisting in image analysis and classification tasks including object detection with good accuracy.
- We will use InceptionV3 which is a network already trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database. Know about [InceptionV3](https://paperswithcode.com/method/inception-v3).
